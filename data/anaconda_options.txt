dirinstall
Use the device mounted at /mnt/sysimage as the installation
destination. The --dirinstall and --image options are mutually
exclusive. The /mnt/sysimage directory can be overridden by
setting the ANACONDA_ROOT_PATH environmental variable before
starting anaconda.

image
Specification of disk image file to be used as installation
destination. IMAGE_SPEC must have format <path>[:<name>] where
<path> specifies the path of an image file and an optional <name>
component is used to identify the disk during installation.
<path> must be a local path but it may be relative or absolute.
If <name> is not specified, a name is synthesized from the
basename of <path>. <name> may not contain a colon or a slash.
This option may be used multiple times to specify multiple disk
images. It is an error to specify the same <path> twice or to use
duplicate names. The --image and --dirinstall options are
mutually exclusive.
