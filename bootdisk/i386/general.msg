You are now ready to begin the installation process.  In most cases, 
the best way to get started is to simply press the 0f<ENTER>07 key.

The graphical installer uses the framebuffer in 16-bit color and 800x600 
resolution. If you are having problems with the graphical installer, try 
one of the following options:
    -  Start the installer in 640x480 resolution by typing 0flowres <ENTER>07.
    -  Avoid using framebuffer mode by typing 0fnofb <ENTER>07.
    -  Try another resolution by appending 'vga=xxx' according to these values:
         1024x768x8bpp  -> vga=773        1024x768x16bpp  -> vga=791 
         1280x1024x8bpp -> vga=775        1280x1024x16bpp -> vga=794

Certain hardware configurations may have trouble with the automatic hardware
detection done during the installation.  If you experience problems during the 
installation, restart the installation adding the 'noprobe' option.

There are a number of parameters that can be passed to the Linux kernel
at boot time.  Press 05<F3>07 for more information.
