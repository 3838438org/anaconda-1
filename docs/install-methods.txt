Description of Anaconda Install Methods (and ways of updating it)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
------------

 - "fully exploded tree" - this is a tree which in the root has the
   the 'RedHat' directory from every CD image merged into a single
   'RedHat' directory.

 - "ISO" - the ISO image for a CD image.

 - "anaconda update" - patches for anaconda to fix bugs/etc

 - all paths without a leading '/' are relative to directory specified
   to installer containing install source.

 - 'updates.img' is a ext2 filesystem containing the updated sources and
   shared libraries for anaconda.
          
Current Installation Methods:
-----------------------------

- CDROM
-------

  Summary:
      This is pretty self-explanatory.  Mounts the CD and installs packages,
      prompts user to switch CDs when the next disc is required.

  Update Options: 
      - floppy.
      - 'updates.img' file in '/RedHat/base' directory of CD #1 image.

- NFS (from a fully exploded tree)
----------------------------------

  Summary:
      Mounts directory from NFS server.

  Update Options:
      - floppy.
      - 'updates.img' file in 'RedHat/base' or 'RHupdates/' directory.
      - updated python or shared libs in 'RHupdates/' directory are 
        used in preference to those in original.

- NFS (from a directory of ISOs)
--------------------------------

  Summary:
      Loopback mounts ISO images from NFS server.

  Update Options:
      - floppy
      - 'updates.img' file in 'RedHat/base' or 'RHupdates/' directory 
      - updated python or shared libs in 'RHupdates/' directory are 
        used in preference to those in original.

- FTP/HTTP (from a fully exploded tree)
---------------------------------------

  Summary:
      Pulls files from tree via FTP.

  Update Options:
      - floppy.
      - 'updates.img' file in 'RedHat/base' directory.

- FTP/HTTP (from a directory of loopback-mounted ISOs)
------------------------------------------------------

  Summary:
      Pulls files from tree via FTP.  Looks in 'disc1/' directory to contain
      files from CD #1, 'disc2/' for CD #2, etc.  These can be created on the
      server by loopback mounting the ISO images into these directories under
      the directory made available to ftp.

  Update Options:
      - floppy
      - 'updates.img' file in '/RedHat/base' directory in ISO image for CD #1.

Hard Drive from fully exploded tree (kickstart only)
----------------------------------------------------

  Summary:
      Similar to NFS method - user specifies a top-level directory and
      all files are sought under there.

  Update Options:
      - floppy.
      - 'updates.img' file in '/RedHat/base' directory.

Hard Drive from ISOs (non-kickstart only)
-----------------------------------------

  Summary:
      Similar to NFS ISO-based method - loopback mounts ISOs in directory
      specified by user.

  Update Options:
      - floppy.
      - 'updates.img' file in '/RedHat/base' directory of ISO image for CD #1.
