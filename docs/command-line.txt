expert          Turns on special features:
                    - allows partitioning of removable media
                    - others?

noshell         Do not put a shell on tty2 during install.

lowres          Force GUI installer to run at 640x480.

nofb            Do not use frame buffer for GUI install.

nousb           Do not load USB support (helps if install hangs 
                early sometimes).

nousbstorage	Do not load usbstorage module in loader.  May help with
		device ordering on SCSI systems.

		of install source (if an ISO-based method).

                in rescue mode.

nopass          Don't pass keyboard/mouse info to stage 2 installer, good for
                testing keyboard and mouse config screens in stage2 installer
                during network installs.


serial          Turns on serial console support.

ksdevice        Takes an argument like 'eth0', tells install what network
                device to use for kickstart from network.

ks              Kickstart over NFS.

ks=cdrom:       Kickstart from CDROM
